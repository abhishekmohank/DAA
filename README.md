Q1. Sort a given set of elements using the
    Quicksort method
    Determine the time required
    to sort the elements.
    Repeat the experiment for different values
    of n, the number of
    elements in the list to be sorted and plot a
    graph of the time taken versus n. The
    elements
    can be read from a file or can be generated
    using the random number generator.
    
Q2. Print all the nodes reachable from a given
    starting node in a digraph using BFS
    method

Q3. From a given vertex in a weighted
    connected graph, find shortest paths to
    other vertices
    using Dijkstra's algorithm
